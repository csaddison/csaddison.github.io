### I'm following my passion for physics and mechanical design.

Hi, I'm Conner Addison. I am a student, designer, and all around pragmatist; working towards my degree in Physics while pursuing my love of design and practical engineering. I also write about the automotive community as well as document the world around me through photography. It's my goal to share my knowledge with tutorials and to make my work available to download and experience for oneself. Read to learn more about the impact I've made on more than 150,000 learners.

### Also check out my ongoing projects:

* [Julia set fractal explorer GUI](https://github.com/csaddison/Fractal-Explorer)
* [A python Perlin noise algorithm](https://github.com/csaddison/Perlin-Noise)
* [Simulating hydralic erosion on procedularly generated terrain](https://github.com/csaddison/Hydraulic-Erosion-Sim)
* Console & web-app based cellular automata
* A* pathfinding simulation in procedularly generated mazes

# Projects

**Asymptotic Analysis & its Applications in Financial Derivative Pricing of European Options with Stochastic Volatility**

I authored a research paper about utilizing higher level math techniques to better estimate the price of European call options, which include regularly traded stocks. The information I learned in the process of writing the paper inspired me to continue the topic into a tractable machine learning program.

**Sterling Schiff Design Channel**

I wanted to share the knowledge I've learned designing in both 2D and 3D programs, so I founded an educational YouTube channel that focuses on teaching CAD and rendering. Now the channel has expanded to over 60,000 viewers.

**BlendSwap CAD Repository**

BlendSwap is a platform for sharing 3D models created in the popular free, open-source Blender program. As a longtime contributor I have amassed over 25,000 downloads, making one of my contributions one of the Top 10 most downloaded Blender files of all time.
