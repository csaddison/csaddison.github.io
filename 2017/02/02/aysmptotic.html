    <h1 id="sub">High-level math in financial derivative pricing or overcoming stochastic volatility</h1>
    <article><p>The Black-Scholes model of evaluating call and put options presumes constant volatility, an assumption that has turned out to be incorrect. This paper discusses how to amend corrections to the model by finding approximations to the stochastic differential equations instead of solving them explicitly. To do this we will utilize asymptotic analysis to find a series for the corrections to the Black-Scholes model while maintaining invariance with respect to the stochasticity of the volatility. Not only is this asymptotic approach easier than finding an explicit solution, it is also considerably faster at approximating than other solution methods, such as the Monte Carlo method.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Securities trade dates back to as early as the 13th century when European governments began selling their debt to wealthy patrons, quickly filling the government’s coffers while agreeing to slowly return the money, with interest. This type of security is called a bond. In general, there are three forms of securities: bonds, which signifies a debt owed to an investor by a government or corporation; equity, which indicates that the investor has partial ownership of whatever they hold equity in; and derivatives, the main focus of this paper, which give an investor the option to access a security at later date at a fixed price. Currently, the market for financial derivatives is valued at $ 1.2 quadrillion, dwarfing the entire globe’s Gross Domestic Product over twenty-fold \cite{aol}.</p>

<p>Financial derivatives comprise most of the complicated and fast moving world of securities investment. They derive–hence their name–their value from an underlying asset, usually a stock or bond but also currencies, commodities, and loan interest rates. At their heart, derivatives are essentially a tradeable contract. When two parties enter a derivative agreement, the seller–the investor or market that holds the underlying asset–gives the buyer the option to buy (referred to as a ‘call’) or sell (referred to as a ‘put’) the asset at fixed price on a later date. For this reason, financial derivatives are often called options. American options allow the buyer to exercise their option at any time before the maturity date, while European options stipulate that the option can only me exercised at the maturity date. This paper, like the research it is based on, deals with the latter.</p>

<p>Unlike cash instruments, which take their value directly from the market–think of common stocks–derivatives represent a buyer’s bet or ‘hedge’ that the price will increase (for a call) or decrease (for a put). Hedges are specific bets aimed at reducing the risk inherent in investment by, in the case of financial derivatives, paying a small premium for option countering one’s main position. The cost of this premium is determined by the asset’s probable payoff, which the Black-Scholes formula calculates as a function of an asset’s volatility.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/option-tab.png" alt="option calls" />
<span class="caption">
This table shows some common variables–$\sigma$, the volatility; <script type="math/tex">\tau</script>, the time until maturity; and <script type="math/tex">S_t</script>, the price of the underlying asset at time t–and the effect of their change on the options price
</span></p>

<p>In the Black-Scholes model, the volatility is considered constant and its value is calculated from the actual observed prices of the asset underlying the derivative. However, Black and Scholes idealization that the volatility is constant is incorrect and their model has a significant drawback due to the fact that it has to be consistently re-calibrated to account for the implied volatility skew. Recent models fix this issue by allowing volatility to vary over time; what’s known as stochastic behavior. While there isn’t yet a consensus on the best way to model the stochastic differential equations and the subsequent corrections to the Black-Scholes formula \cite{lorig}, many mathematicians and financial economists have accomplished what this paper will demonstrate, using asymptotic analysis to approximate the corrections to the existing payoff models.</p>

<h3 id="black--scholes-approach">Black &amp; Scholes Approach</h3>

<p>In 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes published their seminal paper, “The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,” \cite{black-scholes}  which produced a partial differential equation whose solution models the payoff <script type="math/tex">h(S)=(S_T-K)</script> of European options with a known maturity date <script type="math/tex">T</script> and a known strike price <script type="math/tex">K</script> (the price the option gives the buyer a right to). Let <script type="math/tex">S</script> be the price of the underlying asset given at a time <script type="math/tex">t</script> by the following stochastic differential equation (SDE)</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r dt + \sigma dW_t</script>

<p>with Brownian motion <script type="math/tex">W</script> with respect to a historical probability measure <script type="math/tex">P</script>. Let <script type="math/tex">u(S, t)</script> be the value of the option at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>. Then the Black-Scholes equation \cite{black-scholes} is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{du}{dt} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{d^2u}{dS^2} +rS\frac{du}{dS} -ru = 0</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">r</script> is the risk-neutral rate–a rate of guaranteed risk-free return such as a government issued bond–and <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> is the market’s calculated volatility. <script type="math/tex">N</script> denotes the cumulative distribution function of each of the distribution functions <script type="math/tex">d_+</script> and <script type="math/tex">d_-</script>. The CDF returns the probability that a random variable will take a value equal to or less than that of its argument. <script type="math/tex">N(d_+)</script> and <script type="math/tex">N(d_-)</script> represent the probabilities that the option expires in the money; that is, that at it’s maturity time <script type="math/tex">T</script>, <script type="math/tex">K>S_T</script> and the option will be exercised. To simplify further notation we will perform a change of variables such that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
&\tau=(T-t)&
&x= ln(S)&
&k = ln(K)&
\end{align*} %]]></script>

<p>With this new notation, the Black-Scholes PDE can be solved with a solution for call and put options given by:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{split}
C(x, \tau)=&e^{-r\tau}[e^x N(d_+) - e^k N(d_-)] \\
P(x, \tau) =&e^{-r\tau}[e^k N(-d_-) - e^x N(-d_+)] \\
d_\pm&= \frac{x-k \pm \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\tau}{\sigma \sqrt{\tau}} \\
\end{split} %]]></script>

<p>One of the discoveries of the Black-Scholes model is that the price of a derivative is not dependent \cite{lorig} the risk-neutral rate for no-arbitrage situations, meaning that in an idealized perfectly efficient marketplace there are no discrepancies in asset prices to profit off of. Therefore, for any fixed values of <script type="math/tex">(\tau, x, k)</script> the only variable in the options price is the volatility and the price of the call option–which will be the focus of this paper–can be re-written as a function of volatility only:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u(\sigma)=e^xN(d_+(\sigma)) - e^kN(d_-(\sigma))</script>

<p>Analogously written \cite{lorig} as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{split}
u(\sigma)=& \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[S_T-K|ln(S)=x] \\
=&\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[h(S_t)|\mathcal{F}_T] \\
\end{split} %]]></script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{E}</script> is the conditional expectation with respect to a new probability measure <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Q}</script> under which the underlying price is martingale, meaning the next expected value in the stochastic process is equal to the current value. More generally, <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Q}</script> being martingale implies that there is no drift or growth rate and so <script type="math/tex">r=0</script>. The conditional expectation <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{E}</script><strong>[X|H]</strong> of a variable <script type="math/tex">X</script> is the average of of <script type="math/tex">X</script> over all outcomes of <script type="math/tex">H</script>. Equation \ref{conditional ft} gives a value for <script type="math/tex">h(S_T)</script> based on the average of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{F}_T</script>, the historical prices of the market up to time <script type="math/tex">T</script>.</p>

<p>Although Black and Scholes originally presumed volatility was constant, even they soon realized their idealization was incorrect. The Black-Scholes model leads to discrepancies in options pricing represented by the implied volatility skew [Fig. \ref{vol_surf}] and the ‘volatility smile’ [Fig. \ref{smile}].</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vol_surf.png" alt="" />
<span class="caption">
The implied volatility skew is a drawback of the Black-Scholes model. Under their assumption, <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> should be constant and the volatility surface should be flat. Instead, it varies with days till maturity (DTM) and the price of the underlying asset, represented by the parameter <script type="math/tex">\Delta</script> which measures the impact of a change in <script type="math/tex">S</script>.
</span></p>

<p>These discrepancies are accounted for by amending the Black-Scholes formula to allow the volatility to vary with time. This turns equation \ref{stochastic de} into</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dS_t}{S_t}=\sigma_t dW_t</script>

<p>where our Brownian motion is now under <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Q}</script>. We can further specify that the volatility <script type="math/tex">\sigma_t</script> fluctuates stochastically as a function of a diffusion process <script type="math/tex">Y</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\sigma_t = \sigma(Y_t)</script>. Then, letting <script type="math/tex">S_t = e^X_t</script> we are left with two stochastic processes</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
dX_t &= -\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2(Y_t)dt+\sigma(Y_t)dW_t^\mathbb{Q} \\
dY_t&= \alpha(Y_t)dt +\beta(Y_t)dB_t^\mathbb{Q} \\
dW_t^\mathbb{Q}B_t^\mathbb{Q}&=\rho dt \\
\end{split}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">B^\mathbb{Q}</script> is a Brownian motion under <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Q}</script> correlated to <script type="math/tex">W^\mathbb{Q}</script> by <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\mid \rho \mid < 1 %]]></script>. It is standard \cite{lorig} to consider only <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\rho <0 %]]></script> to match the observed behavior that as volatility increases asset prices decrease [Fig. \ref{vol tab}].</p>

<p>We will seek to find solutions for these equations such that <script type="math/tex">u(I)=u</script> in equation \ref{bs formula}, where <script type="math/tex">I</script> is the volatility parameter that causes the Black-Scholes formula to the match observed price. Solutions to equation \ref{conditional ft} can be obtained by brute force Monte Carlo methods, plugging in random inputs to slowly piece together a continuous distribution, but this procedure is especially inefficient at the iterative process of recalibrating the Black-Scholes model for the implied volatility. Therefore we want to find a suitable approximation for <script type="math/tex">u(t,x,y)</script> that corrects for the volatility skew without explicitly resolving for a new value of <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script>.</p>

<h3 id="aysmptotic-perturbation-theory">Aysmptotic Perturbation Theory</h3>

<p>Finding a solution to our quandary is accomplished with the application of asymptotic analysis, specifically perturbation methods. The key element of asymptotic analysis is that it finds and approximation for a function in a limiting behavior, either towards infinity or zero, without requiring the expansion to converge. Formally, a series is an asymptotic expansion of a function <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> if, for every term additional term in the expansion, the ratio of the error to the last term goes to 0 as <script type="math/tex">x\to\infty</script> \cite{boas}. Denoted mathematically:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \phi_n(x)</script>

<p>where the ~ denotes the asymptotic relationship if <script type="math/tex">\forall n=N</script> where <script type="math/tex">N \in \mathbb{N}</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left |f(x)-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \phi_n(x) \right | \div \phi_N(x) \to 0</script>

<p>as <script type="math/tex">N\to\infty</script>. The requirements for an asymptotic expansion as <script type="math/tex">x\to 0</script> are similar:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x)\sim\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x_n</script>

<p>if <script type="math/tex">\forall n=N</script> where <script type="math/tex">N \in \mathbb{N}</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\left |f(x)-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x_n \right | \div x_N \to 0</script>

<p>A demonstration of the usefulness of asymptotic analysis is to solve for Stirling’s Formula, which approximates <script type="math/tex">n!</script> as <script type="math/tex">n\to\infty</script>. Let <script type="math/tex">\Gamma(z)</script> be the Gamma function <script type="math/tex">\Gamma(z)=\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\Gamma(z+1) = z!</script>, then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">z!=\Gamma(z+1)=\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z}e^{-t}dt</script>

<p>as <script type="math/tex">z\to\infty</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">a^b=e^{bln(a)}</script> then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Gamma(z+1)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t+zln(t)}dt</script>

<p>Substitute <script type="math/tex">t=zu</script> and <script type="math/tex">dt=zdu</script> so that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">=ze^{zln(z)}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-z(u-ln(u)}dt</script>

<p>Now we try and find the minimum of <script type="math/tex">f(u)=u-ln(u)</script> so that we can find the maximum value of <script type="math/tex">e^{-z(u-ln(u)}</script>. Plugging in the result of that we get</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">=zz^ze^{-z}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-z(\frac{1}{2}x^2}dt</script>
<script type="math/tex">\sim z^ze^{-z}\sqrt{2\pi z}\left(1+\frac{1}{12z}+...\right)</script></p>

A comparision of Stirling Approximation with the Gamma Function and the factorial $n!$.

<p>The derivation above is the same as one demonstrated during lecture.</p>

<p>Now we have both of the SDE’s  that govern the dynamics of our asset price and volatility as well the methodology to create an accurate approximation of the SDE’s about the price given by the original Black-Scholes formula.</p>

<h3 id="applying-the-perturbation">Applying the Perturbation</h3>

<p>We left off with equations \ref{conditional ft} and \ref{stochastic volatility}, whose solutions we are trying to approximate. Equation \ref{stochastic volatility} is an example of a Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process \cite{fouque1998}; a stochastic process that meets the requirement to be both a Gaussian and Markov process. All a Markov process means is that the next state of the process can be predicted solely on the current state of the process, while the Gaussian condition implies that our domain is continuous instead of discrete.  An OU process is ergodic, meaning that in the long run it tends towards its own average. This property allows us to introduce a small perturbation <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script> in our variables that allows us to determine the correction terms for the Black-Scholes model as $\epsilon\to0$.</p>

<p>We can represent the payoff as in \ref{conditional ft} by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u^\epsilon(t,x,y)=\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[\varphi(X_t^\epsilon|X_t^\epsilon=x,Y_t^\epsilon=y]</script>

<p>where we can replace <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{F}_T</script> by <script type="math/tex">(X_t, Y_t)</script> due to their Markov properties. It doesn’t matter what time we start at, <script type="math/tex">(X,Y)</script> will eventually revert to their average values. Just as equation \ref{conditional ft} corresponds to equation \ref{stochastic volatility},equation \ref{expected epsilon} corresponds to the SDE’s</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
dX_t^\epsilon&=rX_t^\epsilon dt +e^{Y_t^\epsilon}X_t^\epsilon d W_t^\mathbb{Q} \\
dY_t^\epsilon&= \frac{\alpha}{\epsilon}(Y_t^\epsilon)dt + \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\left(\rho d W_t^\mathbb{Q} +\sqrt{1-\rho^2}dB_t^\mathbb{Q}\right)
\end{split}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>According to numerous sources \cite{fouque1998,fouque2003,lorig}, there need be only mild boundary conditions on <script type="math/tex">X</script>, <script type="math/tex">Y</script>, and <script type="math/tex">u(t,x,y)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">u(t,x,y)</script> is the solution to the Kolmogorov backward equation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{L}^\epsilon u^\epsilon(t,x,y)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">u(T,x,y)=\varphi(X_T)</script> and the operator <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}^\epsilon</script> is defined \cite{fouque2003} as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{L}^\epsilon&=\frac{1}{\epsilon}\mathcal{L}_0 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\mathcal{L}_1 +\mathcal{L}_2 \\
\mathcal{L}_0&=\nu^2\frac{d^2}{dy^2}-y\frac{d}{dy}\\
\mathcal{L}_1&=\sqrt{2}\rho\nu \sigma(y) \frac{d^2}{dxdy}-\sqrt{2}\Lambda(y)\frac{d}{dy} \\
\mathcal{L}_2&=\frac{d}{dt}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2(y)\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\left(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2(y)\right)\frac{d}{dx}-r
\end{split}
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}_2</script> is also the Black-Scholes operator defined in equation \ref{bs pde} and the function <script type="math/tex">\sigma(y)</script> is the volatility as a function of Y, as mentioned earlier in this paper. The Greeks, <script type="math/tex">\Lambda</script> and <script type="math/tex">\nu</script> (called ‘vega’ in finance), are measures relating to the impact of a change in <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> for <script type="math/tex">\nu</script> and a ratio given by <script type="math/tex">\frac{\delta u(t,x,y)}{\delta S_t}</script>. The Kolmogorov backward equation (KBE) allows us to find probabilistically whether a given variable x will be in a subset of states B at a later time t. As far as it is concerned for this paper, the KBE just allows us to progress towards approximating a simpler solution for <script type="math/tex">u(t,x,y)</script>. Since equation \ref{eps de} is first-order with respect to <script type="math/tex">\sqrt{\epsilon}</script>, we can expand for <script type="math/tex">u(t,x,y)</script> in terms of that:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u^\epsilon(t,x,y)=u_0+\sqrt{\epsilon}u_1+\epsilon u_2+ \epsilon^\frac{3}{2}u_3(t,x,y)+...</script>

<p>We want this expansion to be independent of the stochastic volatility so its easier to solve, thus we let</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Q^\epsilon(t,x)\sim u_0(t,x,y)+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}u_1(t,x,y)</script>

<p>as <script type="math/tex">\epsilon \to 0</script>. By substituting equations \ref{expansion} and \ref{approx} into equation \ref{operators} we can create an series that by definition satisfies the KBE and the associated boundary conditions. That expression is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline}
\frac{1}{\epsilon}\mathcal{L}_0 u_0 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\left(\mathcal{L}_0 u_1 +\mathcal{L}_1 u_0 \right) \\
+ \left(\mathcal{L}_0 Q_2 + \mathcal{L}_1 u_1 +\mathcal{L}_2 u_0 \right) \\
+ \sqrt{\epsilon}\left(\mathcal{L}_0 Q_3 + \mathcal{L}_1 Q_2 + \mathcal{L}_2 u_1 \right) + ...
\end{multline}</script>

<p>All that is left at this point is to reduce equation \ref{series} to a more informative state. To do this we will adopt the methodology from Fouque (2003) \cite{fouque2003} and show that equating the first four leading terms of our expansion to zero proves equation \ref{approx}. If we consider our first term</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{L}_0 u_0=0</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}_0</script> only has derivatives with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script>, we can quickly see that if our proposed solution is not a function of <script type="math/tex">y</script> that the first term must equal 0. Similarly, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}_1</script> differentiates with respect to <script type="math/tex">y</script>, so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{L}_0 u_1 +\mathcal{L}_1 u_0=0</script>

<p>is also true. The third and fourth terms</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{L}_0 Q_2 + \mathcal{L}_1 u_1 +\mathcal{L}_2 u_0=0</script>

<p>and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{L}_0 Q_3 + \mathcal{L}_1 Q_2 + \mathcal{L}_2 u_1=0</script>

<p>reduce to Poisson Equations \cite{fouque2003} for <script type="math/tex">Q_2</script> and <script type="math/tex">Q_3</script>, respectively. Solving these a solution for a solution <script type="math/tex">\Phi</script> gives conditions that give numerical meaning to our final approximation [Fig. \ref{examp}], which is successfully independent of <script type="math/tex">y</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{multline}

<p>We have shown that the Black-Scholes model \ref{bs formulas} for determining European call prices is deficient in that it lead to the implied volatility skew [Figs. \ref{vol_surf}, \ref{smile}]. We have also summarized the efforts of others to reconcile the Black-Scholes discrepancy by allowing for time-varying volatility. While this fixes the model, it makes it far harder to solve the SDE’s. However, we have shown that by applying perturbation theory–asymptotic analysis as <script type="math/tex">\epsilon\to 0</script>–it is possible to find an accurate [Fig. \ref{examp}] approximation for the price <script type="math/tex">u(t,x,y)</script> that is invariant with respect to y. This invariance makes the asymptotic approach to the issue of implied volatility skew substantially easier and faster to solve than previous methods, such as the Monte Carlo brute force method of recalibration. There is still far more to be researched in this field, as most of the sources used for this project struggled to account for real world intricacies such as transaction costs, arbitrage situations, and American options.</p>

This is the ‘volatility smile’ for the S&amp;P500, and the skew is clearly noticeable as you tend away from the at-the-money point, <script type="math/tex">S_T = K</script>

This is the graph of a numerical example of the asymptotic analysis compared to the calculated data. Here, the input parameters are <script type="math/tex">\epsilon=\frac{1}{200}</script>, <script type="math/tex">\nu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</script>, <script type="math/tex">\rho = -.2</script>, and <script type="math/tex">r=.04</script>. The parameters for the asymptotic expansion are <script type="math/tex">\sigma=.165</script>, <script type="math/tex">V_2^\epsilon=-3.30/times10^{-4}</script>, and <script type="math/tex">V_3^\epsilon=8.48\times10^{-5}</script>. This example was taken from Fouque (2003) \cite{fouque2003}}
